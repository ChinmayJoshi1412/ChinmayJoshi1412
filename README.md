### I am a recent graduate from Vellore Institute of Technology with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and Engineering. As a Frontend Developer, I specialize in creating user-friendly applications with a strong focus on performance and design. I have hands-on experience with a variety of frameworks, including Android SDK, Flutter SDK, and React JS, which allows me to deliver dynamic, responsive, and scalable applications.
